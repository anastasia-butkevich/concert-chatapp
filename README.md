TODO MVP:
1. Create endpoints: ingest/, chat/
2. Implement logic of data retrieval and validation (with llm?)
3. Implement data storing logic (embeddings + vector db)
4. Implement rag and chatting logic
5. Add streamlit interface

Additionally:
6. Think if it's a good idea to store docs locally ?
7. Think of chat history storing logic ?
8. Think where I can use Bing API here for web search ?
